TI Legal and policy barriers to renewable and sustainable energy sources in
   South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW & BUSINESS
AB Renewable energy is growing worldwide in terms of generation capacity and investment inflows. However, barriers to the transition to renewable energy remain in many countries. This article analyses the barriers to renewable energy in South Africa in the context of global growth, which in 2014, saw South Africa in the top 10 of investments into renewable energy. Regulation through law has potential to address many of the barriers to renewable energy, but investors should understand the nature and extent of these barriers to guide future investment decisions into renewable energy. Law is one of the social, regulatory, and economic instruments that can be used to control and shape development. However, in South Africa the energy and environmental law and policy have not sufficiently addressed the obstacles to renewable energy technologies. Cheap fossil fuel energy led to short-term economic growth, which, in the long term, is not environmentally sustainable. While a lot has been done to enable renewable energy, challenges remain that may make it difficult for investors and foreign corporations to enter the South African renewable energy market. This article concludes that, while the context (socioeconomic and political) of obstacles to renewable energy is relevant, legal and policy barriers are overriding and should be the focus of effort in order to create an enabling regulatory environment.

TI Modeling environmental policy with and without abatement substitution: A
   tradeoff between economics and environment?
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB This study proposes a set of optimal emission taxes that could be used to fully internalize environmental externalities. Carbon fees are computed for low-income economies, lower-middle-income economies, upper-middle-income economies, high-income economies, China and the United States. Subsequently, the implementation of these emission taxes is evaluated under two different scenarios; one assuming abatement substitution and the other relaxing this assumption. Estimated damages and abatement from various sectors lie between 0.0003 to 0.021 and 0.001 to 0.012 lb per dollar output respectively. Optimal pollution taxes per dollar output range as high as 2.8% for heavy manufacturing in the high income countries, and as low as 0.01% in the service sectors of the low income countries. On the impacts of these taxes, the study produces evidence that, whether abatement substitution is present or not, production in low-income economies would be less adversely affected due to carbon taxes relative to high-income countries. In addition, the emissions taxes reduce environmental damages by nearly 50% in all regions. Worldwide welfare gains from internalizing negative externalities when no abatement substitution is present is about three times the welfare gains in the presence of abatement substitution. Although these results imply a sort of tradeoff between the economics of production and environment, improved environmental benefits due to carbon taxes seem to outweigh the deterioration in economic activities; and as such, welfare improves in general.

TI Dynamic linkages among energy consumption, environment, health and
   wealth in BRICS countries: Green growth key to sustainable development
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The objective of the study is to examine the four pillars of green growth (or green environment) i.e., energy, environment, health and wealth in BRICS countries namely, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, over the period of 1975-2013. The study examines the relationship between energy consumption, environment, health and its resulting impact on BRICS' economic growth. The study used three environmental variables (i.e., agricultural technology, carbon dioxide emissions and population density), three energy sources (i.e., nuclear energy consumption, electricity production from renewable sources and combustible renewable & waste), two health proxies (i.e., fertility rate, total i.e., births per woman, and infant mortality rate) and GDP per capita for economic growth. These variables were selected due to the vital importance in the BRICS nations. The overall results indicate that environmental variables have a deleterious effect on the BRICS economic growth, while energy sources significantly increases economic growth in the countries. Health expenditures and infrastructure required proper care of fertility and mortality related health issues in the BRICS countries. The results emphasized the importance of green growth and sustainable developmental policies that help to expedite growth process and welfare of the countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The spatial distribution of renewable energy infrastructure in three
   particular provinces of South Africa
SO BULLETIN OF GEOGRAPHY-SOCIO-ECONOMIC SERIES
AB Renewed interest is being shown in South Africa in the promotion of infrastructure for renewable energy (RE) to supplement the country's current energy-generation capacity and to break loose from its dependency on an unsustainable fossil-fuel-based energy-provision system. The latter system not only has unfavourable consequences for the environment, but is managed by a state-owned institution which since 2008 has been incapable of providing reliable electricity. RE infrastructure-especially for the generation of solar and wind energy-is a relatively new feature in the South African landscape. This paper examines the spatial distribution of the newly commissioned infrastructures for wind and solar energy (operational and under construction) and the role they can play in the diversification of the rural economies of parts of the country's Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. First, literature on evolutionary economic geography, path dependence and new path creation is reviewed. Second, the role of a single energy provider-embedded in a monopolistic energy policy-in inhibiting the transition from a mainly fossil-fuel-based energy-provision system to a multi-source (multi-owner) provision system is discussed. Third, the reasoning behind the siting of the infrastructures for solar and wind energy in three particular provinces is explained. Fourth, the possible roles these new infrastructures can play in the diversification of the rural economies where they occur are advanced. The paper concludes that solar-and wind-energy projects have the ability to transform the South African energy context and that these projects present some positive socio-economic impacts for rural economies in the three particular provinces. The paper also recommends that future research efforts should be aimed at the evolution of this socio-economic transformation by taking into account the pre-development context of the areas under study.

TI Regulating energy in South Africa: enabling sustainable energy by
   integrating energy and environmental regulation
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY & NATURAL RESOURCES LAW
AB The fragmented development of energy law and regulation on the one hand and environmental law on the other is militating against the adoption of a sustainable energy system in South Africa. This mirrors the absence of a global regime on energy to align with environmental developments at that level, despite the recognition that energy is central to sustainable development. Since 1996, environmental law in South African has been reformed to embed it in sustainable development, yet such reforms have not been in synergy with developments in energy regulation. This paper argues that one of the key strategies required in building a sustainable energy system is to create regulatory synergy between environmental law and energy law. Renewable energy and relevant environmental law should be facilitating the technology transition from unsustainable fossil based energy (that is behind climate change) towards renewable energy.

TI An analysis of the solar service provider industry in the Western Cape,
   South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB Scientists agree that rising electricity usage of the rapidly growing human race to improve its standard of living is negatively affecting the environment. To create a sustainable environment for future generations, renewable and environmentally friendly resources have to be exchanged for the present finite resources. In South Africa, coal plants are responsible for more than 90% of electricity production. This means that action has to be taken now to start a process of change to sustainable electricity resources.
   This paper focuses on the South African solar industry. Due to the high sun radiation levels, solar technology is one of the renewable energy sources with the greatest potential. The industry is in its infancy, characterised by accelerated growth expectancy and fuelled by factors such as government subsidies, the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices and the increasing focus on economical long-term sustainability. The expected growth necessitates a focus on the market positioning of solar service providers in the Western Cape, with the aim of taking full advantage of the opportunities associated with this industry.
   The main objective is to determine the current structure of the solar service provider value chain and subsequently areas of improvement to increase growth, stakeholder satisfaction and sustainability.
   A literature review was conducted to address the research objective, relevant approaches and the broader electricity industry. Porter's Value Chain approach was used as a foundation for the adaptation to the solar service provider value chain. Porter's Five Forces model was also used as a secondary approach, which analysed the competitive environment of the solar service provider industry in the Western Cape.
   The methodology entailed a qualitative research approach in the form of semi-structured interviews. All respondents were general managers or owners of a solar service provider, who were interviewed face to face. The research focused on the entire population of solar service providers in the Western Cape. Seventy-seven different service providers were targeted, of which 18 were interviewed. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using content and frequency analysis. To guarantee reliability, a pilot study was conducted to ensure that the respondents understood the questionnaire.
   The findings show that customer service is the foremost value driver for solar service providers. This entails the actual installation of the product as well as the people skills of the installation team. As most customers only have to be served once due to the long life span of the products, marketing also plays an obvious role in attracting new customers.
   The most important outcome of this paper is the determination and a better understanding of the solar service provider value chain in South Africa. The recommendations, especially with regard to marketing and service elements, could improve the performance of solar service providers. The consequence could be an increase in stakeholder satisfaction and an enhanced usage of solar energy in South Africa. Future research should focus on customers to reveal preferences and opportunities for marketing approaches.

   South Africa
SO DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB Loss of biodiversity is putting the South African economy and the quality of life of its citizens at risk. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is a way to incentivise conservation, community-based natural resource management and restoration of the environment. This article discusses a proposed PES project through the generation of hydro-electricity in the Blyde River Canyon Nature reserve. It argues that this proposed project could serve as an example for other PES projects and that it would strengthen community-based natural resource management, be beneficial to environmental conservation, counteract climate change, and provide socio-economic benefits to surrounding communities.

TI The mapping of maximum annual energy yield azimuth and tilt angles for
   photovoltaic installations at all locations in South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB Photovoltaic (PV) technology is fast emerging as a viable energy supply option in mitigation against environmental degradation through the burning of traditional fossil fuels The cost of the technology, however, still poses a major challenge, as the efficiencies are generally still quite modest Current research efforts to improve efficiency are mainly focused on component physics and manufacturing technologies Little attention seems to be paid to improved system design at field level Traditionally it is assumed that a panel installed at a tilt angle that is equal to the latitude at a location should achieve maximum annual energy yield for a non-tracking installation However, in practice, due to a number of factors such as wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, global and diffuse irradiation and other climatic factors, the optimum azimuth and tilt get more convoluted In this paper the optimum angles (azimuth and tilt) to maximise annual energy yield for fixed angle PV installations at all locations in South Africa have been tabulated Climate data software together with solar design software were used in determining the angles The availability of these tables will offer an additional support tool to the country in promoting the growth of PV as a viable alternative energy generation technology for both urban as well as the most secluded rural areas that are not grid connected

TI Connecting political economies of energy in South Africa
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The South African energy debate is and will remain a heated one. Given South Africa's history of racial inequality and contemporary concerns around sustainability, much of it rightly focuses on the links between energy, poverty and the environment. Yet, many contributions to the (mainstream) debate seem to have a somewhat one-sided focus that might hamper rather than stimulate the understanding of these links. They either display a strong technical, quantitative bias and/or lean towards rather simplistic ideas about policy processes and dynamics. The article argues that many of these analyses could benefit greatly from a critical focus on the political economy of energy: the political-economic power structures that influence both many energy policies and the issues of energy equality and sustainability. Two major global developments emphasise the importance of this focus: the recent financial crisis and South Africa's role in the increasingly tense geopolitics of energy in Africa. The article concludes with some suggestions on how currently disparate political economies of energy could be better connected. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Renewable energy and the environment in South Africa: A way forward
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The need to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of fossil fuel usage, the volatility of fuel prices and enhancement of national energy security, have largely driven a phenomenal growth, around the world, in renewable energy (RE) generation (particularly grid-connected), over the past two decades. The necessity to apply policy support instruments to promote the dissemination of these technologies is now a universally accepted norm. Different countries and societies depending on the prevailing socioeconomic environment draft and apply their policy frameworks differently and debates abound as to which mechanisms should have been most suitable under which circumstance. Most of these debates, however, assume the existence of an intrinsic political environment in favour of the process. In South Africa the current political environment is not very conducive to the development of a sustainable RE industry. This paper explores some of the anomalies and barriers and suggests possible options for a way forward to a viable RE industry in the country. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Grappling with a half-hearted policy: The case of renewable energy and

SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Integrated resource planning (IRP) of power generation and delivery characterized by higher penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) has taken the 21st century world by storm. It promises power markets that are more resilient to resource and capital cost uncertainties as well as environmental sustainability. The success of this new paradigm has been largely anchored by decisive support policy mechanisms and good implementation. But while the developed and emerging economies are registering phenomenal growth in their renewable energy industries, South Africa would appear to be caught in a time warp with a weak environment policy and a power sector that continues to plan its future in the traditional way. The consequences are continued environmental degradation and a high-energy intensive economy with intermittent power supplies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
